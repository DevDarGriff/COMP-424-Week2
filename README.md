1) The form for my site is an account creation form. The form allows users to sign up for an account, which will allow the user to track their golf scores from the favorite golf courses.

2) The inputs for the sign-up form on my site are: Name, Email Address, and Password. My validate rules are as followed: Name must be longer than 2 characters, Email requires a valid email address, and Password must be longer than 8 characters. Additionally, I added a checkbox button allowing the user to agree to terms of service, however, I was unable to make it work as intended, so I will continue to troubleshoot for next week.

3) Feedback is presented underneath each applicable input field. Additionally, each field with an error is focused with a red box that outlines which fields must be corrected to successfully complete account registration; accompanied by a message to the user detailing how they can resolve the issues with their input.

4) I utilized the Console tool within DevTools. Console allowed me to effectively troubleshoot issues with the DOM, the functionality of the site's input fields, and the respective errors accompanying those fields.
